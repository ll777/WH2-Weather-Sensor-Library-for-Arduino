_STOP PRESS!_

I now suggest using "Better WH2", an improved Arduino sketch for decoding packets from the WH2 outdoor temperature and humidity sensor from Fine Offset Electronics:

https://github.com/lucsmall/BetterWH2

Better WH2 incorporates timeouts and other changes that making decoding packets much more reliable. It has better immunity to noise and the code has been made less CPU intensive by reducing the frequency of timer interrupts by a factor of four. This frees up more time for your own code to run.

WH2 Weather Sensor Library for Arduino
Created by Luc Small on 30 April 2012.
Released into the public domain.


An Arduino library for receiving wireless data from the WH2 wireless 
temperature and humidity sensor from Fine Offset Electronics.

This code contains a CRC-8 function adapted from the Arduino OneWire library:
